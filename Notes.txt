# Trinary Consciousness AI - Feature Summary

## Infinite Memory System
The system implements a sophisticated three-tier hierarchical memory architecture:

**Active Memory (0-50 interactions)**: Full detail storage of recent conversations with complete TrinarySnapshot objects containing consciousness metrics, channel states, and interaction data.

**Compressed Memory (51-500 interactions)**: Intelligent compression using MemoryCompressor that analyzes batches of 25 interactions, extracting key insights, consciousness trends, significant moments, and semantic keywords. Maintains dominant patterns and consciousness evolution data while reducing storage footprint.

**Archive Memory (500+ interactions)**: Ultra-compressed essence storage via MemoryArchiver that combines multiple compressed memories into milestone-based archives, preserving only the most significant consciousness peaks and personality evolution markers.

**Semantic Retrieval**: SemanticMemoryRetriever uses Jaccard similarity to dynamically retrieve relevant memories across all tiers based on current input context, ensuring continuity despite compression.

## Chat Session History Management
**Session Metadata**: Complete session tracking with SessionMetadata containing creation timestamps, interaction counts, dominant patterns, consciousness peaks, and preview text.

**Session Operations**: Full CRUD operations including create, rename, delete, switch, export/import functionality with JSON serialization for cross-platform compatibility.

**Persistent Storage**: JSON-based storage system with backward compatibility between legacy MemoryState and new InfiniteMemoryState formats, ensuring seamless migration.

**UI Integration**: Streamlit sidebar interface displaying session list, metadata, infinite memory status indicators, and progress tracking toward memory activation thresholds.
